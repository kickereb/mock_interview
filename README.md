# Behavioural

Give me a recent example of a stressful situation on the job. What happened? How did you handle it?

### Bottlenecks

- [x]  Answered the question in the star model.
- [x]  Was able to get to at least 3 minutes for a question without further probing.

### Nitpicks

- [ ]  Too much technical jargon
- [ ]  Nervousness and a lack of preparation
- [ ]  Too much focus on one aspect and lack on other aspects

### Score + Notes

# Easy Question 15min

[Ransom Note - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)

## Confirming question

### Bottlenecks

- [x]  Asked for all the constraints.
- [x]  Created their own example and confirmed with interviewer to confirm understanding of question.
- [x]  Repeat the question back in their own words.

### Nitpicks

- [ ]  Proceeded with assumptions like assuming the array is sorted.
- [ ]  Wasn't able to identify key information that would have helped solve the question.

### Score + Notes

## Algorithm design

### Bottlenecks

- [ ]  Explicitly wrote out the pseudo code for their algorithm, and confirmed if it was okay with the interviewer.
- [x]  If not immediately arriving at the best solution, demonstrated ability to create a subpar algorithm.

### Nitpicks

- [ ]  Pseudo code was hard to read (It's up to the interviewee to correctly explain their algorithm to the interviewer)
- [ ]  Interviewer didn't type out all the logic, and primarily thought it up in their head.

### Score + Notes

## Complexity analysis

### Bottlenecks

- [ ]  Was able to work out both the correct space and time complexity.
- [ ]  Was able to justify the space and time complexity.

### Nitpicks

- [x]  Did not go through every section of the code explicitly and explain the time complexity of that section.

### Score + Notes

Space complexity required probing to get, time complexity changed as you spoke about it

## Coding

### Bottlenecks

- [x]  Implementation was correct and the ideas in the pseudo code are implemented as intended.
- [x]  While the code was being typed out the interviewee was vocal and explained their through process

### Nitpicks

- [x]  Did not comment their code as they were writing it out.
- [ ]  Went silent while typing out the code.
- [ ]  Code had incorrect syntax.

### Score + Notes

## Testing

### Bottlenecks

- [x]  They tested their code and was able to show that they algorithm works correctly and as intended.
- [x]  They created variables, and showed how those variables changed as it moved through the code for a given input.

### Nitpicks

- [ ]  Did not create a visual aid for questions difficult to visualize.
- [ ]  Glossed over the test.
- [ ]  Did not choose a particularly difficult test case.
